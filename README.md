This game was created for the Adelaide Game Developer's SA Slam Jam 2022, the theme for this jam being **Oversaturated** with the optional mutator of **RTFM** (Read the F**king Manual). For this we at **S-C-A-Ms** have created the wonderful **Project Honeypot** an Adelaide based dating simulator staring **Winnie-The-Pooh** to display **Jizney's** abuse of copyright laws and with Winnie-the-Pooh coming into the public domain at the beginning of this year what time better than now. Our goal was to show the **Oversaturation** of **Jizney**.
